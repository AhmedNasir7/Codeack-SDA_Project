# Codeack-SDA_Project_Frontend

A platform dedicated to code maniacs!

## Environment variable

Create a `.env.local` file that points the frontend to the backend API (defaults to `http://localhost:3000` if omitted):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

This same URL is used by the landing-page compiler to send run requests to the backend.
